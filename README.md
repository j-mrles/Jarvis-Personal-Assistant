# Contextual Chatbot with TensorFlow

This project aims to develop a Contextual Chatbot using TensorFlow, leveraging neural networks to understand and interact in human language. Inspired by advancements in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), this chatbot represents a significant leap beyond rule-based systems, offering a more intuitive and flexible way for users to engage with technology.

## Project Overview

The core of this project lies in understanding user intents and providing appropriate responses, which makes it not just a script-driven bot but one that can learn and adapt through context. This is achieved through the implementation of a Deep Learning model in TensorFlow, capable of understanding natural language and generating responses based on the context of the conversation.

### Features

- **Intent Recognition**: Utilizes NLP techniques to discern the user's intent from their messages.
- **Context Handling**: Maintains conversation context to provide relevant responses.
- **Scalability**: Designed to easily incorporate more intents and responses as the system grows.
- **Framework Flexibility**: While TensorFlow is used for model development, the project structure allows for experimentation with other NLP frameworks.
